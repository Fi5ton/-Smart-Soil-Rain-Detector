**SMART SOIL-RAIN DETECTOR**

This is a PCB design of an ESP32-WROOM module accompanied with soil moisture sensor and rain sensor in easyEDA. The sensors are intended to be connected to ESP via pin headers on them. ESP32 has a USB connector on which the codes will be uploaded, therefore proper functioning of this module  to achieve real time readings through sensors.

**OBJECTIVES**

The objective of this project is to design and implement a **smart soil and rain detector system** using ESP32 and supporting sensors.  
The system monitors **soil moisture** and **rainfall presence**, and provides both **analog readings** and **digital alerts**.  
This allows farmers, gardeners, or hobbyists to automate irrigation and weather monitoring effectively.

**COMPONENTS USED**

- ESP32 DevKitM-1  
- Soil Moisture Sensor (Analog + Digital outputs)  
- Rain Sensor (Analog + Digital outputs / Buzzer module)  
- Resistors (1kΩ, 10kΩ, 47kΩ)  
- Potentiometers (10k trim pots)  
- Capacitors (0.1µF, 10µF)  
- LEDs (indicator)  
- Active/Passive Buzzer (for rain alert)  
- NPN Transistor (BC547/2N3904 for buzzer driver)  
- Connecting wires / Jumper headers
